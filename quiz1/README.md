# Quiz 1 information for Fall 2022

## What do you need to take the Quiz

1. The complete [instructions and questions for the Quiz](431-quiz1.pdf) (this should be a 26 page PDF).
2. The four .csv data sets (algae, newborn, pcare and sleep) we are providing to help you with several Quiz questions. (posted to our Shared Drive in the Quiz 1 folder, and also to the [data subfolder above](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2022/tree/main/quiz1/data))
    - When imported into R, [algae.csv](data/algae.csv) should show 200 observations on 18 variables,
    - [newborn.csv](data/newborn.csv) should show 130 observations on 2 variables,
    - [pcare.csv](data/pcare.csv) should show 111 observations on 7 variables, and
    - [sleep.csv](data/sleep.csv) should show 134 observations on 1 variable.
3. The [R Markdown file](data/question7_initial.Rmd) and [HTML file](data/question7_resultswewant.html) we are providing to help you with Question 7 on the Quiz. (also posted to our Shared Drive in the Quiz 1 folder, and to the [data subfolder above](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2022/tree/main/quiz1/data))
    - **NOTE** On 2022-10-07, I placed a revised version of the [HTML file](data/question7_resultswewant.html) online here and on the Shared Drive. The only difference is that the old version had three tick marks at the bottom, which it shouldn't have. The new version does not have these tick marks. The tick marks aren't associated with any of the critical errors or the bonus issue in Question 7.
4. This link to [the Google Form Answer Sheet](https://bit.ly/431-2022-quiz1-answer-sheet) you'll use to submit your responses. Remember you need to be logged into Google via CWRU to open the form.

## Reminders

If you need help during the Quiz, you have exactly two ways to get it:

1. You can ask your question in a private question to the instructors on Campuswire, or
2. You can ask your question via email to **431-help at case dot edu**.

We promise to respond to all questions received before 5 PM on 2022-10-10 at that time, if not sooner.
