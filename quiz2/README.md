# Quiz 2 information for 431 Fall 2022

## Changes Since Initial Posting

- 2022-12-01 at 12:07 PM: reposted Quiz [instructions and questions PDF](431-2022-quiz2.pdf) to fix Question 06 and Question 07.
    - Question 06a now reads "Identify the student code for the subject with the largest number of missing values who also identified themselves as a current smoker." 
    - Question 06 also provides specifications on what the `smoker` variable codes mean (so you don't have to refer to Question 10).
    - Question 07a now asks that you round the p values to four decimal places, to match the Google Form.

## What do you need to take the Quiz

1. The complete [instructions and questions for the Quiz](431-2022-quiz2.pdf) (this should be a 35 page PDF).
2. The four .csv data sets (quiz_hospsim, quiz2_ra, quiz2_surveyA, and quiz2_wtchg) we are providing to help you with several Quiz questions. (posted to our Shared Drive in the Quiz 2 folder, and also to the [data subfolder above](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-quizzes-2022/tree/main/quiz2/data))
    - When imported into R, [quiz2_hospsim.csv](data/quiz2_hospsim.csv) should show 650 observations on 11 variables,
    - [quiz2_ra.csv](data/quiz2_ra.csv) should show 350 observations on 3 variables,
    - [quiz2_surveyA.csv](data/quiz2_surveyA.csv) should show 494 observations on 11 variables, and
    - [quiz2_wtchg.csv](data/quiz2_wtchg.csv) should show 50 observations on 4 variables.
3. This link to [the Google Form Answer Sheet](https://bit.ly/431-2022-quiz2-answer-sheet) you'll use to submit your responses. Remember you need to be logged into Google via CWRU to open the form.

## Reminders

If you need clarification on a Quiz question, you have exactly three ways of getting help:
